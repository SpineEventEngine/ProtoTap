ProtoTap is a Gradle plugin that allows tapping output of Protobuf compiler used in the project to
which the plugin is applied, and placing them as `test` resources. 

This way authors of code generators can focus on writing tests rather than on "plumbing" with
[Protobuf Plugin for Gradle][protobuf-plugin] or creating a custom diagnostic plugin for
Protobuf Compiler (`protoc`).

## How it works

ProtoTap interacts with [Protobuf Plugin for Gradle][protobuf-plugin] for copying generated code and
related files to `test` resources of the project.

## Basic features

### Automatic selection of a source set
When tuning code generation, the plugin attempts to find [`testFixtures`][test-fixtures] source set
in the project first. If not found, the plugin attempts to find the `test` source set.

Using other source sets requires explicit setting, as described in the [section](#settings) below.

### Copying `protoc` output
The code generated by `protoc` will appear in corresponding subdirectories of the `prototap`
subdirectory under `test/resources`. For example:

```
my-project
  build
    resources
      test
        prototap
          java   <-- The output of `java` built-in of `protoc`.
            HelloWorld.java
```
After this, the code of your tests will be able to access the generated code as usual program
resources.

### Obtaining `CodeGeneratorRequest` file
[`CodeGeneratorRequest`][codegen-request] is passed by `protoc` to its plugins when `.proto` files
are processed. ProtoTap stores the binary version of the request in the file
named `CodeGeneratorRequest.binbp` next to the directories with the generated code:

```
my-project
  build
    resources
      test
        prototap
          java
          CodeGeneratorRequest.binbp  <—— The request file.
```

## Simplest usage

Adding to your project via Kotlin DSL looks like this:
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("io.spine.prototap") version "$version"
}
```
The above snippet assumes that the plugin with the ID `"com.google.protobuf"` is already added at
some level to your project.

> [!TIP]
> For the latest ProtoTap version please see [`version.gradle.kts`](version.gradle.kts).
> 
> The plugin was developed and tested under Gradle 7.6.4.

## <a name="settings"></a>Using plugin settings
You can tune ProtoTap by using the following DSL:

```kotlin
prototap {
    artifact.set("com.google.protobuf:protoc:3.25.1")
    sourceSet.set(functionalTest)
    generateDescriptorSet.set(true)
}
```
The `artifact` property is a convenience shortcut for specifying the `protoc` artifact in case
your project does not have explicit `protobuf` block.

The `sourceSet` property is for specifying a source set with the proto files of interest, other
than `testFixtures` or `test`.

The `generateDescriptorSet` property makes the Protobuf Compiler produce a descriptor set file,
which ProtoTap places next to `CodeGeneratorRequest`:

```
my-project
  build
    resources
      test
        prototap
          java
          CodeGeneratorRequest.binbp  
          FileDescriptorSet.binpb <—— The descriptor set file.
```
By default descriptor set files are not generated.
